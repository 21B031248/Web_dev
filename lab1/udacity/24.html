  <h1>ChatGPT</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer,commonly called ChatGPT, is a chatbot launched by OpenAI in November 2022. 
        It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models, and is fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning)
        with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT was launched as a prototype on November 30, 2022, and quickly garnered attention for its detailed responses and 
        articulate answers across many domains of knowledge. Its uneven factual accuracy was identified as a significant drawback.
        Following the release of ChatGPT, OpenAI was valued at $29 billion.</p>
